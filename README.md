- 👋 Hi, I’m @KatriinaMatthiesen
- 👀 I’m interested in using Git for managing content, mainly for technical documentation, and then how to manage multiple outputs, and languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Git, as I'm new to this. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with writing, content, content strategy, languages, and technical documentation.
- 📫 How to reach me ... for the time being via Git. Let's see what this has to offer ;-)
